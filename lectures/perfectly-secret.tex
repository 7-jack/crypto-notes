\section{Perfectly-Secret Encryption}
\label{perfectly-secret}

Various notes from chapter 2 of \cite{katz-lindell}.

\begin{definition}[Perfectly Secret Encryption Scheme]
    Even an adversary with \textit{unbounded} computational power cannot break a \vocab{perfectly secret encryption scheme}.
\end{definition}

First, we must formally define an encryption scheme.
\begin{definition}[Encryption Scheme]
    Consists of three algorithms:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\Gen$, which outputs a key $k$ according to a distribution. The key space is denoted by $\KK$ and is finite.
        \item $\Enc(k, m)$, which encrypts $m$ under $k$. The space of possible ciphertexts is denoted by $\CC$.
        \item $\Dec(k, m)$, which decrypts $m$ under $k$.
    \end{itemize}
    And also a message space $\MM$ where $|\MM| > 1$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Perfectly Correct]
    For all $k \in \KK$, $m \in \MM$, if $c \sampledfrom \Enc_k(m)$ then $\Dec_k(c) = m$ with probability 1.        

    Unless stated otherwise, we will be working with perfectly correct encryption schemes.
\end{definition}

Note that we will reference distributions over $\KK, \MM$, and $\CC$. The distribution over the key space is given by $\Gen$. The distribution over the message space models how not all messages have equal probability of being sent.

$\KK$ and $\MM$ are independent distributions, as messages are chosen independent of keys. However, $\CC$ is fully determined by the distributions over $\KK$ and $\MM$. The distribution of $\KK$ is fixed for a given encryption scheme since it is defined by $\Gen$, but $\MM$ may vary depending on the parties. 

\begin{definition}[Perfect Secrecy]
    An encryption scheme $(\Gen, \Enc, \Dec)$ is \vocab{perfectly secret} if for all $m \in \MM, c \in \CC$ such that $\Pr[C = c] > 0$, we have 
    \[ \Pr[M = m | C = c] = \Pr [M = m]\] % TODO: define a macro for s.t. |
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
   Intuitively, this says that observing a ciphertext does not change the a priori probability of a message being sent. 
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
    In the future we may omit conditions such as $\Pr[C = c] > 0$ simply for convention and ease of use; however, it is implicitly there. See exercise 2.6.
\end{remark}

\begin{lemma}
    An equivalent definition of perfect encryption states
    \[\Pr[C = c | M = m] = \Pr[C = c] \]
\end{lemma}

Another equivalent and useful formulation of perfect secrecy is \textit{perfect indistinguishability}. % TODO: add stuff to the dictionary
\begin{definition}[Perfect Indistinguishability]
   \vocab{Perfect Indistinguishability} states that given $m_0, m_1 \in \MM$, then 
   \[\CC(m_0) = \CC(m_1) \]
   where $\CC(m_i)$ denotes the distribution of ciphertexts for the encryption of $m_i$.
\end{definition}

Phrased differently,
\begin{lemma}
An encryption scheme $\EncScheme$ over $\MM$ is perfectly secret iff for all $m_0, m_1 \in \MM, c \in \CC$,
\[\Pr[C = c | M = m_0] = \Pr[C = c | M = m_1] \]
\end{lemma}

The final equivalent formulation of perfect secrecy is \textit{adversarial indistinguishability}.

\begin{definition}[Adversarial Indistinguishability]
    The intuition is that an adversary cannot distinguish between the encryption of two messages better than simply guessing. It is a taste of future "game based" definitions of security.

    We define an experiment $\text{PrivK}^\text{eav}$ in the setting of private key encryption and an eavesdropping adversary. It is defined for a scheme $\Pi = \EncScheme$ over $\MM$ for arbitrary $\AA$. One execution of the experiment is denoted $\text{PrivK}^\text{eav}_{\AA, \Pi}$ and defined as 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $\AA$ chooses a pair of messages $m_0, m_1 \in \MM$.
        \item $k \sampledfrom \KK$ and $b \sampledfrom {0, 1}$. $c := \Enc(m_b)$ and given to $\AA$.
        \item $\AA$ outputs  $b'$.
        \item If $b = b'$ then the output of the experiment is 1. Otherwise it is 0.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}[Adversarial Indistinguishability]
    An encryption scheme $\EncScheme$ over $\MM$ is perfectly secure if for all $\AA$,
    \[ \Pr[\text{PrivK}^\text{eav}_{\AA, \Pi}] = \frac{1}{2}. \]
\end{lemma}
